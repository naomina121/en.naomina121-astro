## Introduction

This time, as a follow-up to the previous article ‘[A Patient's Record of Setting Up a VPS and Battling Ghost During Protective Hospitalisation](/mental-health/vps-ghost/),’ I have written an article concerning ‘metacognition.’

Please rest assured that the content of this article has been structured so that it can be understood without having read the previous piece.

If you're curious about the [previous article](/mental-health/vps-ghost/), do take a look.

<div class="box2">
<strong>Precautions before reading the article (just in case)</strong>
<p style="font-size:15px;">※ Firstly, regarding the research papers introduced in this article, <br />
<u class="orange">‘Please note that the research is based on specific groups and may not apply to everyone.’</u>   </p>

## No More Falling for Misinformation! The Power of '[Metacognition](/tags/metacognition/)

<p style="color:skyblue;">Why do hoaxes spread so rapidly?<br />Have you ever found yourself wondering about this?<br />The truth is, this phenomenon stems from how the brain functions.<br /></p>

---

The brain typically employs two distinct modes of thought: ‘System 1’, an intuitive, fast-processing mode for immediate judgements, and ‘System 2’, a logical, deliberative mode.

The amygdala, the older part of the brain governing fear and emotion, uses “System 1”, while the newer part, the prefrontal cortex, responsible for reason and logical judgement, governs “System 2”.

These are known as the **dual-system theory**, which gained prominence and became established in the field of psychology through a paper published in 2000 by psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West.

<p><b style="color:#ac4b4b;">In essence, the human brain tends to judge matters intuitively using ‘System 1’ unless consciously engaged, meaning disinformation spreads more readily when people feel anxious or fearful.</b></p>

Let us now examine some real-world examples.

---

### Could the disinformation surrounding the ‘coronavirus’ outbreak have been entirely prevented?

A prime example might be recalled from when the coronavirus first began to spread.

When the coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, various false claims spread across social media, such as: <b class="green2">Wearing a mask is dangerous because it causes oxygen deprivation</b> and <b class="green2">Alcohol-based disinfectants are actually harmful to your health, so you should avoid them</b>.

Prejudice and discriminatory views towards Chinese people also ran rampant.

Discriminatory posts such as ‘<b style="color:#ac4b4b;">Chinese people are dangerous, stay away</b>’ were frequently seen on social media directed at Chinese individuals, who were perceived as the source of infection.

However, viruses are beyond human control, and it is impossible to control their source of origin.

Regarding the minimum infection prevention measures we can take, the only real recourse is to maintain everyday hygiene practices (such as handwashing and gargling).

---

Whenever new viruses or disasters like earthquakes occur, various rumours will inevitably circulate.

It is impossible to prevent this entirely.

<p class="bold" style="color:#bb8282;">So, what do you think you should do? </p>

---

### How would you avoid being swept up by rumours?

So, is there a way to prevent the amygdala from going into overdrive and being swept up by rumours intuitively?

<p><u class="gold">Actually, the answer was mentioned at the beginning.</u></p>

Did you spot it?

<div class="box"><p><small>💡The hint lies in pausing for “this very moment”.</small></p></div>

If you've found the answer, you can skip this section.

---

### Don't you think there might be more than one answer?

I won't present the answer.

Because it's entirely up to you.

Now, let's move on to the next point.

---

Actually, the ability needed to question the underlying assumptions of things, view matters from multiple angles, and refrain from jumping to conclusions is called “**metacognition**”.

“Metacognition” is the “**power to step back and observe one's own thoughts and feelings**”.

For instance, even when troubled by something,

<ul class="list">
<li>“Ah, I'm thinking like this right now”</li>
<li>‘Is this assumption truly correct?’</li>
</ul>

By taking this step back to observe things from a bird's-eye view, you can gain control over your emotions and maintain a calm perspective on matters.

In other words, if you can train the logical thinking of System 2 in the prefrontal cortex, you become less susceptible to being swayed by misinformation because you make judgements after careful deliberation.

### The Story of Nao, a Patient Who Programmed in a Psychiatric Hospital

Regarding the “metacognition” mentioned earlier, let me share my personal experience to illustrate where it actually comes into play.

Readers who saw the previous article may skip this section.

<p class="bold green2">Despite being hospitalised for schizoaffective disorder, a mental illness, I recovered sufficiently within just one month to obtain permission from my doctor to use a computer. I then built a server on a VPS and deployed a Ghost blog. </p>

Putting it this way often leads to comments like:

<p class="bold big pink">‘It sounds like a religious recruitment pitch, doesn't it? lol’</p>

...but
...metacognition is a legitimate field within neuroscience.

For details,

can be found here.

That said, that said.

「<b class="green2">Does research truly show that enhancing metacognition improves mental health and information literacy? </b>"
you might wonder.

So this time, using international academic papers, I'll discuss **the links between metacognition, information literacy, mental health, and learning outcomes**.

<div class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Metacognition is a concept defined by American psychologist John H. Flavell, originally a term used in cognitive psychology. In neuroscience, it refers to the prefrontal cortex's involvement in cognitive functions (learning and problem-solving abilities). It can be considered an essential ability for controlling emotions and making rational judgements by understanding ‘<span class="yellow">what one is currently thinking and what emotions one is processing</span>’.
</div>

## Findings from a Survey of 195 Medical Students

First, we present a study by a Japanese research team (Taniguchi et al., 2024) involving 195 medical students.

This research analysed the relationship between students' metacognition and their emotional state under the influence of COVID-19.

Particularly striking was the finding that **students who felt **less confident in their own thoughts and judgements** tended to experience greater emotional instability**.

This tendency was especially pronounced among female students, highlighting the need to carefully identify **who requires what kind of support**.

In essence, **those whose emotions are more easily unsettled require educational support that bolsters their metacognition (i.e., their trust in their own thinking)**.

When emotions fluctuate, it can be helpful to reflect: ‘What kind of thought pattern am I in right now?’

---

## Neuroscience Reveals the Secrets of “Confidence” and “Judgement”

Next, we examine a review paper by British researchers Seow et al. (2021).

This paper analyses data from over 300 individuals from a neuroscientific perspective, specifically examining **‘Which brain regions are involved in metacognition?’**

A particularly intriguing finding from this research is that <b style="color:#a193e9;">the sensation of feeling “confident” and the ability to ‘judge correctly’ are processed in entirely separate brain networks</b>.

Indeed, it has been reported that **individuals with stronger tendencies towards depression or anxiety often exhibit extremely low self-confidence**, indicating that ‘how one perceives oneself’ significantly impacts mental stability.

<div class="box">

These factors tend to reduce confidence, as consciously directing attention outward to consider ‘what one must do for someone else’ can diminish self-assurance.

<p class="orange">This is because our minds, particularly the prefrontal cortex governing rational thought, are wired to avoid impulsive judgements. When we wish to please someone or act for another's benefit, positive information processing takes precedence over darker thoughts, allowing us to maintain a calm state.</p>

Psychological research indicates that simply engaging in positive activities (such as helping others or performing kind acts) or positive thinking activates the brain's reward system (releasing feel-good substances like dopamine), which has the effect of calming stress hormones and anxiety. In other words, actions that bring joy to others also brighten one's own emotions, naturally making negative thoughts less likely to arise.

Additionally, there is a psychological concept called <span class="orange">reframing (cognitive reinterpretation)</span>, which provides an opportunity to shift towards constructive thinking.

</div>

## Can Metacognition be Utilised in Information Literacy Education?

Next, we present American research concerning information literacy education in universities.

This study analysed library educators and instructional materials, revealing that **when teaching information reliability, the step of “reflecting on one's own judgement” is almost entirely absent**.

Theoretically, metacognition is considered indispensable for information evaluation, yet this perspective is missing in practical instruction.

Particularly now that social media and online searches are primary information sources, **the habit of asking ‘Why did I believe this information?’ becomes a crucial skill for avoiding misinformation**.

Here too, we see increasing scenarios where metacognitive abilities are being tested.

When encountering information, how do you think one should consider why they were inclined to believe it?

## The Relationship Between Discerning Health Information and Metacognition

Let me share another intriguing study.

This research, conducted with 502 Reddit users, revealed that <b class="pink">how accurately one can judge health-related information is significantly influenced by metacognition</b>.

Specifically, the ability to independently verify information's authenticity is underpinned not only by media literacy but also by metacognitive skills – the capacity to question, ‘Have I truly understood this correctly?’

<div class="box2">
However, it was also observed that individuals exposed to excessive information tend to experience diminished metacognitive function. **
This highlights the risk that ‘knowing too much’ can actually cloud one's own judgement.
</div>

It may be advisable to limit the areas of information one engages with daily, avoiding excessive overload. Mindfulness is also said to be effective. However, it has been pointed out that this could have adverse effects for those with mental health conditions or trauma.

When your mind isn't functioning well, taking proper rest is advisable.

## Learning to Enhance Problem-Solving Skills and Deepening Metacognition

Metacognition is also intrinsically linked to the very act of learning itself.

A problem-based learning (PBL) course conducted at an Australian university yielded results showing that <b class="pink">students' generic problem-solving abilities improved by 13% in just one semester</b>.

Incidentally, ‘a 13% improvement represents a level where more than one in ten individuals demonstrate clear advancement.’

Furthermore, research involving Indonesian primary school pupils revealed that **‘how one understands a problem’ significantly influenced test scores**.

In essence, the process of independently contemplating challenges and solving them through trial and error cultivates **the ability to reflect on one's own thinking – metacognition**.

I felt this perspective could be applied regardless of age or subject.
