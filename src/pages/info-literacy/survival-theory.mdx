The term “theory of survival for the socially disadvantaged” can be substituted with “right to survival”.

However, the deliberate addition of “socially disadvantaged” stems from the need to highlight how dangerous eugenic ideology is, and how anyone can easily fall into its trap, alongside the notion that protecting the socially disadvantaged contributes to societal well-being.

Incidentally, the term “socially disadvantaged” here refers to individuals in socially disadvantaged positions, such as the unemployed, the elderly, persons with disabilities, the impoverished, foreigners, and those disadvantaged due to their abilities, etc.

Foreigners are included because, within Japan's systems, foreign workers are often placed in a disadvantaged position, and they are frequently treated as socially disadvantaged individuals even within immigration policy.

Such socially disadvantaged individuals are often targets of criticism in matters of justice.

## Why Justice is Not Necessarily Right

Japanese education typically pairs the admonition ‘****Do not cause trouble for others****’ with the exhortation ‘****Be of use to others****’.

- ‘****Work and be useful****’
- ‘****Contribute to society****’

These two are prime examples.

They are necessary actions in society.

However, things that appear correct at first glance can, when turned on their head, become dangerous ideologies.

****Justice is about being useful to someone****.

Why do people feel anger? It arises to protect what is important to them.

If someone criticises, saying ‘****Why can't you even manage this?****’,
it's because they don't want to feel inferior to others and are defending their own position.

Simultaneously,
by pointing out flaws and correcting the other person (believing it's for society's sake), they feel justified.

****The problem with the legitimacy of justice is that one can create endless ammunition for attack based on how much one believes they are serving someone (society).****

The notion that killing can be justified in the name of justice stems from a mindset that believes anything is permissible under that banner.

Examples include:

---

- Those lacking ability are lazy and must have their attitude corrected

- Those who commit moral wrongs must be thoroughly crushed

- It's absurd that people with mental disorders harm others and go unpunished; they should face the death penalty

---

Simply being useful to others can shift values so drastically depending on the person.

So why is justice dangerous?

For instance, when someone is driven to death by online backlash and slander, the perpetrators don't necessarily feel guilty.

Online lynching is violence cloaked in the guise of justice by the masses, where perpetrators' responsibility often becomes obscured.

Beyond mere persistence, the excessive use of aggressive language against others under the banner of righteousness is described in neuroscience as ‘****righteousness addiction****’.

People derive pleasure from the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, when they wield righteousness to slander others.

In other words,
the thought

‘****People who cause trouble for others should simply disappear****’
and the sentiment

‘****I want to die because my very existence burdens and troubles others****’

both stem from the same underlying principles: ‘****being useful to others****’ and ‘****not causing trouble for others****’.

## Yielding to peer pressure hinders rational judgement

Japan is a country where peer pressure is particularly strong.

Firstly, humans are prone to yielding to peer pressure.

This is termed the ‘conformity bias’.

It signifies a cognitive bias where one prioritises ‘aligning with the majority opinion over judging right from wrong’ and ‘not contradicting everyone else's views’.

Furthermore, there is also a cognitive bias where one thinks, ‘****If many people believe it, it might be the correct opinion****.’

This is called the ‘social proof bias.’

Indeed, haven't you encountered people justifying their own opinions by saying, ‘****Because everyone else is saying it****’?

Social media, in particular, carries the risk of creating an ‘echo chamber phenomenon’. This occurs when you follow people who support your views or consume biased information, leading to a skew in your own opinions.

The fact that everyone is doing it further reinforces the justification.

One might even say things like, ‘It was a necessary sacrifice as a form of social sanction,’ or ‘It's rather worse to commit suicide over something like that,’ or ‘Well, everyone's doing it...’

The reason we can't correct whether this is wrong is because our metacognitive function is weak.

So, how can we avoid becoming addicted to righteousness?

****Train your metacognition****.

This means objectively observing one's own actions...

Engaging the prefrontal cortex not only aids in improving mental illnesses like depression and anxiety disorders,
but also creates moments where one can step back and calmly ask:

‘****Is what I'm doing right now truly the correct thing to do?****’

## Why Eugenics Was Once Believed to be Correct

Now, let's return to the topic of ‘****eugenics****’.

Darwin's theory of evolution is well-known, but it was his cousin, Francis Galton, who combined it with ‘modern statistics’ to lay the foundations of “eugenics”.

‘If superior individuals marry among themselves for generations, superior humans will increase.’

However, in Britain at the time, eugenics was largely ignored.

Yet, in America, the introduction of this British eugenic ideology led to the actual development of a eugenics movement.

German eugenics is well-known, but there was also an American eugenics movement.

IQ tests were devised, labelling Black people as mentally deficient.

The Bureau of Eugenics Records was established, designating the socially vulnerable – the disabled, the poor – as ‘unfit’. Consequently, centred on white supremacy, policies such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilisation were implemented.

(In Japan too, eugenic ideology manifested in the form of the former Eugenics Protection Law.)

(In Japan too, eugenic ideology manifested in the form of the former Eugenic Protection Law.)

Now, this American eugenics movement took Nazi Germany as its model.

The mass murder of Jews, the Holocaust, is well known,
but simultaneously, the infamous “mercy killing” programme known as Operation T4 saw the murder of over 200,000 disabled people.

The justification for these killings also stemmed from a sense of justice.

The reasoning was: ‘****Families with disabled members face increased burdens and unhappiness, so it is better to kill the disabled individuals****.’

We now understand that even in our own era, there remains a danger of being tainted by such eugenic ideology.

In 2016, the perpetrator of the Sagamihara disability facility attack, who killed 19 people, acted on precisely the same motive: to reduce the burden on families and society.

Consider this:

When we see tragic news of families committing suicide together because a disabled child was born, or families taking their own lives due to the burden of care,
or when we encounter, perhaps through social media, the reality of the inconvenience disabled people cause society and how innocent non-disabled people are harmed, doesn't it seem plausible that the very thought of protecting someone could be justified as a necessary sacrifice?

This represents the ultimate expression of the belief that ‘being useful to others is wonderful, and one must not cause trouble for others.’

Furthermore, this mindset gave rise to the concept of ‘personal responsibility.’

The background to the argument that ‘failing to demonstrate one's abilities is the individual's own fault’
can be said to stem from the misconception that meritocracy is something that can be resolved through effort alone.

## Problems Unsolvable by Effort: Considering the Limits of Meritocracy Born from Capitalism

The greatest benefit of Japanese capitalism is that it propelled the nation into the ranks of advanced economies through its period of high economic growth.

The diversification of goods and services led to an improvement in consumers' quality of life.

Following the principles of the free market, society entered an era of competition, where companies began to value individual ability and pursue success.

**At the core of capitalism lies meritocracy.**

While what society demands of individuals varies with the times, it is clear that what is required is the demonstration of ability.

However, this simultaneously places demands on every individual to possess such ability. Yet, the evaluation of this ability or talent varies between people and is not necessarily fair.

Furthermore, the pursuit of ability has created economic disparities, leading to overwork-related deaths and mental illnesses stemming from excessive stress imposed upon workers.

****Meritocracy cannot account for circumstances beyond an individual's control – environment, illness, or disability can all limit one's abilities.****

Japan, having experienced high economic growth, subsequently faced the collapse of the bubble economy and was enveloped in a severe recession (the Lost Decade).

Economic fluctuations caused management difficulties, leading to a significant reduction in new graduate hiring. This created a generation struggling to find employment.

(Commonly referred to as the Ice Age Generation)

This problem stemmed from concepts within Japan's employment system, such as the ‘one-shot job hunt’ and ‘seniority-based promotion’. Consequently, failing in the job hunt once had a profoundly serious impact on subsequent career paths.

The effects of ‘low income’ also made marriage difficult and created problems regarding retirement savings and pensions.

Incidentally, as you likely know, the so-called second ice age generation refers to the COVID generation who sought employment in 2020 and 2021.

## The illusion that effort pays off

The reality is that the notion that ‘effort pays off’ or ‘grit will get you through’ only holds true for those in environments (or with networks) where they can demonstrate their abilities – it is a privilege afforded to the capable.

Furthermore, there is the question of whether most people can necessarily work within such favoured environments.

The tendency for meritocratic values – that superior individuals have worth while inferior ones lack it – to emerge stems precisely from this meritocracy.

It is because meritocracy is so highly valued that people are prone to embrace eugenic ideas.

As mentioned earlier, the notion that failing to demonstrate ability is ‘****one's own responsibility****’ arises because

people are steeped in the mindset that ‘****if one strives, one can demonstrate ability; those who cannot do so simply haven't strived enough****’.

It is a culture that equates ****effort = perseverance**** with virtue.

Why must you persevere and endure difficult work?

Why should you feel distressed about being unable to work?

As long as we live in a capitalist world, meritocracy is inevitable.

The theory of personal responsibility cannot cover individual abilities.

Relief measures are necessary.

Believing those without ability are worthless and unnecessary individuals causes social loss.

## First, understand that ability is not something controllable through effort

****We cannot choose our parents at birth. ****

****We cannot choose our upbringing or the era we live in.****

****We are not guaranteed to be born able-bodied.****

****We cannot avoid the possibility of illness or disability.****

****We are subject to the effects of ageing.****

****Human abilities have individual differences and limitations.****

****Effort alone cannot solve everything. ****

## Why a Survival Theory for the Socially Vulnerable is Essential
1. **Social Stability**

When the socially vulnerable can lead stable lives, the stability of society as a whole increases. Poverty and inequality can lead to rising crime rates and social unrest. Therefore, supporting the socially vulnerable contributes to the stability of society as a whole.

2. **Protection of Human Rights**

To ensure all individuals enjoy fundamental human rights, a minimum standard of living is essential. Thus, supporting the survival of the socially vulnerable is crucial for respecting and protecting human rights.

3. **Social Equity**

A survival theory is necessary to provide equitable opportunities to those who have become socially vulnerable due to circumstances beyond their control, such as illness or disaster.

4. **Human Dignity**

A theoretical framework to guarantee the survival of the socially vulnerable is necessary when aiming for a society where all individuals can live with dignity.

5. **Social Solidarity**

Supporting the socially vulnerable enhances a sense of unity and community, promoting overall social harmony and solidarity.

6. **Economic Soundness**

Enhancing the purchasing power of the impoverished is crucial for maintaining a healthy economic cycle. Their presence as consumers contributes to market stimulation and the creation of demand.

To establish a survival theory for the socially vulnerable, considering the current situation of a declining birth rate and ageing population, the following policies are necessary at the national level:

1. **Redistribution Policies**

These include **progressive taxation (where tax rates increase as income rises) and welfare programmes**. Such policies mitigate wealth disparities and support the survival of the socially vulnerable by redistributing society's overall wealth.

2. **Education and Health**

Within a capitalist society, education is a crucial element for enhancing capabilities and acquiring new skills. Striving to improve one's abilities and safeguarding health are vital. Furthermore, directing attention towards health fosters an understanding of illness. This provides the knowledge and skills necessary for economic success and cultivates the capacity to compete in the market. Education is also a key means of promoting social mobility and mitigating inequality.

3. **Social Security**

Social security systems mitigate economic risks arising from illness, unemployment, old age, and disability, thereby enhancing quality of life. This preserves individuals' freedom to pursue self-fulfilment and maintains overall social stability.

4. **Job Creation**

The capitalist economy continues to grow, generating new employment opportunities. This provides people with income and means to support their livelihoods. Creating a society where people can work regardless of illness, disability, educational background, or work history unlocks the potential of people's abilities. Flexible working hours, teleworking, retraining programmes, and various other methods will be utilised.

5. **Social Enterprises**

Organisations such as social enterprises and NPOs, which pursue social value alongside profit, contribute to supporting the socially disadvantaged and creating employment.

6. **Review of Immigration Policy**

Expanding the acceptance of immigrant workers from abroad, alongside domestic labour, is one option. This not only supplements the workforce but also brings diversity and fresh perspectives to society. However, decisions should not be based on national character; social security and medical insurance systems are also essential for maintaining public order. Measures to counter the declining birth rate are considered necessary to establish the social security system, as they increase consumption tax revenue, securing the system's funding.

7. **Human Rights**

Japan recognises the right to life. A society where dignity is upheld for all lives fosters a sense of security across society and helps address the declining birth rate.

Social support for child-rearing is also essential.

1. **Education and Awareness**

Promote societal understanding and respect for the value of child-rearing and family life. This includes providing information through educational programmes and media.

2. **Social Support**

Encourage involvement from local communities and voluntary organisations in supporting child-rearing and family life. This enables not only individual families but society as a whole to share the burden of child-rearing and provide support.

3. **Cultural Transformation**

Promote a transformation in the values and attitudes of society as a whole, such as gender equality and the sharing of household chores and childcare responsibilities. This requires not only policy changes but a cultural transformation across society.

## The notion that worthless people should not exist is unnecessary

A limitation of capitalism is the issue of meritocracy.

Consequently, it can also lead to feelings of worthlessness stemming from a loss of confidence due to an inability to demonstrate one's abilities.

‘**The theory of survival for the socially disadvantaged is an approach aiming for a society where all people have fair opportunities and can live as healthily as possible.**’

To realise this, a **health-first approach** is indispensable.

Humans are different creatures; individual differences in ability exist, and some people cannot demonstrate their abilities. It is necessary to instil at the educational level that there are times and circumstances when people cannot work, and that there are problems beyond the control of effort alone.

At such times, what can be done is to actively utilise the nation's social security system.

If the funding for the nation's social security can be linked to consumption activities, it can lead to the revitalisation of the regional economy.

We need to change the value system that equates an inability to demonstrate ability with being unnecessary to society.

The more people advocate a “theory of survival for the socially vulnerable”, the more it fosters a sense of security, ease, and values that affirm “I, too, have the right to live”. This, I believe, can help reduce suicide rates.

Thank you for reading this far.

I sincerely hope this serves as an opportunity to reconsider just how vital the right to life truly is.
