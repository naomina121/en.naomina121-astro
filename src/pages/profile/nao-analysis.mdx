## CliftonStrengths

With top-ranked strengths largely being strategic, there is a pronounced tendency towards gathering information and analysing its accuracy. This style involves a sense of responsibility in disseminating information, refining ideas into a more effective form while communicating responsibly.

They also choose their words carefully. They enjoy considering solutions when problems arise, making them an information-providing type who can offer solutions when sharing information.

However, their problem-solving is limited to situations they can handle independently, and their collaboration skills are low.

Therefore, it is important to note that they tend to be weak when it comes to consulting others.

## VIA

It is consistent that Prudence also ranks highly in CliftonStrengths.

The high Creativity also makes sense, as it overlaps with the ability to generate ideas and express them.

High Intellectual Flexibility also aligns with high strategic strengths in CliftonStrengths. This likely reflects a preference for developing ideas while considering multiple directions.

Scholarly and Curiosity likely stem from a tendency towards learning motivation and broad interests. Daily information gathering probably influences this too.

Conversely, while Individualisation was high in CliftonStrengths, VIA shows a strong tendency towards Fairness.

This stems from a mindset where, while one wishes to avoid discrimination or prejudice, one also desires to tailor responses to suit each individual.

Though seemingly somewhat contradictory, the fairness here refers strictly to ethical conduct, and Individualisation should probably be considered separately.

## BIG5-BASIC

<img src="/images/a-1.png" alt="Nao's Big Five Personality Assessment Results"/>

Being introverted can be attributed to a strong tendency towards individualism.

Considering that Intimacy and Individualisation rank highly in Clifton Strengths, and Communication is a lower-ranked trait, it can also be said that she finds interpersonal communication challenging and feels more stable when acting independently.

When viewed through VIA, Contemplation ranking first strongly suggests introversion significantly influences this.

Cooperation is low, though assertiveness and clear expression of personal views are observed when necessary.

Diligence is excessively high, possibly due to overly high self-assessment. This could stem from heightened responsibility manifesting as a tendency to complete tasks thoroughly, keep promises, and adhere to rules.

Emotionality remains stable except during illness, suggesting heightened logic and strategic thinking during normal calm states. These align with Clifton Strengths.

### Assessment Results

#### Extraversion

>You tend to have low Extraversion. Individuals with low Extraversion are often perceived as reserved, humble, thoughtful, and possessing a unique worldview. Privately, you likely prefer hobbies enjoyed in small groups over lively gatherings with many people. Professionally, you excel in roles requiring independent thinking and focused concentration. Psychological research suggests introverted individuals often possess strong logical reasoning abilities. This makes careers in research or academia particularly suitable.

#### Emotional Stability

> Emotional stability tends to be high. Individuals with high emotional stability are characterised as being calm, composed, less prone to negativity, and resilient to stress. They can respond calmly even in chaotic situations, meaning they are less likely to make impulsive mistakes.

#### Openness

>Openness tends to be high. Individuals with high openness are characterised by strong curiosity, a preference for new information, an appreciation for the arts, and a spirit of adventure. They tend to be highly motivated to take on challenges and tackle tasks proactively. Their superior imagination and creativity make them well-suited for careers demanding ideas and flexible thinking, such as planning roles, research positions, or fields like design and art.

#### Conscientiousness

>Characterised by a strong sense of responsibility, consistency, keeping promises, and diligently executing plans. Your sincere nature likely earns you the trust of many. At work, you approach tasks earnestly and steadily, demonstrating the tenacity to see through what you undertake to the end. Research by Judge et al. at the University of Iowa found that individuals high in conscientiousness tend to have higher ‘job satisfaction’ and ‘occupational status’. Many also report greater job satisfaction.

#### Agreeableness

>You tend to score low on agreeableness. Those with low agreeableness are characterised by not reading the room, being competitive and challenging, not being swayed by others, and maintaining their own pace. As they are less concerned with others' reactions or social standing, they can make strong, forthright assertions. At times, these assertions can save the group in a crisis.

## 16personalities

It may be best to view 16personalities not as an official MBTI diagnostic tool, but rather as a playful personality assessment.

This is because even if such traits exist, whether one remains consistently in the same state can vary depending on the timing of the assessment.

In this sense, the Big Five model tends to be more reliable.

Regarding 16personalities analysis: in a healthy state, the result tends towards an A rating; when affected by mental health issues, it leans closer to a T rating.

Being an Introvert (I) aligns with the Big Five.

Being an Intuitive (N) corresponds to high Creativity in the Big Five.

Being a Thinking (P) type aligns with high Logic in the Big Five.

Being a “Planner” (J) aligns with high conscientiousness in the Big Five.

Being assertive (A) aligns with low agreeableness in the Big Five.

## Examining why these outcomes emerged

### Heightened by the anxiety of ‘not being able to fail’

Not being able to fail is akin to perfectionism. Past influences significantly shape this tendency.

Developed logical thinking to avoid emotional reactions.

### Intense loneliness from having no one to rely on fosters strong learning ability

Tendency to fill the loneliness of not being able to rely on others through self-solving via information gathering and learning.

Developed a strong sense of responsibility due to a lack of trust in others.

### Creativity developed to escape the harshness of reality

Ideas evolved to devise possibilities for confronting real-world problems.

Self-expression through fear-avoidance defence mechanisms became linked to creativity.

### Summary

These issues stem from childhood abuse and bullying, which I believe have transformed into my current strengths.

While they may appear as a negative legacy, there is hope that wounds can be transformed into strength.

However, this should not be interpreted as justifying the abuse or bullying.
