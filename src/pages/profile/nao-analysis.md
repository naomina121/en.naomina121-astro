CliftonStrengths

With top strengths largely being strategic, there is a high tendency to gather information and analyse its accuracy. This style involves feeling a sense of responsibility for disseminating information, refining ideas in a better form, and communicating responsibly.

Furthermore, words are chosen carefully. As they enjoy considering solutions when problems arise, they can be described as an information-sharing type who can present solutions when providing information.

However, this problem-solving is limited to situations they can resolve independently, and their collaborative approach is relatively weak.

Therefore, it is important to note that they tend to be less inclined to seek advice from others.

## VIA

It is consistent that Prudence also ranks highly in CliftonStrengths.

The high Creativity also makes sense, as it aligns with the ability to generate ideas and express them.

The high Intellectual Flexibility also aligns well with the high Strategic strength in CliftonStrengths. It is likely that one enjoys refining ideas while considering various directions.

Scholarly and Curiosity likely stem from a tendency to have a strong desire to learn and take an interest in various things.

Furthermore, daily information gathering likely influences this.

Conversely, while Individualisation scored highly in Clifton Strengths, Fairness tends to be prominent in VIA.

This stems from a mindset where one wishes to avoid discrimination or prejudice, yet seeks to tailor responses to individuals.

Though seemingly contradictory, the Fairness here pertains strictly to ethical conduct, whereas Individualisation should be considered separately.

## BIG5-BASIC
<img src="/images/a-1.png" alt="Nao's Big Five Personality Assessment Results"/>

Being introverted can be attributed to a high tendency towards individualism.

Considering that Intimacy and Individualisation rank highly in Clifton Strengths, and Communication is a lower-ranked trait, it can also be said that interacting with others is challenging, and acting independently leads to greater stability.

When viewed through VIA, Prudence is again ranked first, suggesting the introverted temperament may be significantly influencing this.
Cooperation is low, and there is evidence of asserting oneself when necessary and clearly stating one's opinions.

Diligence is rated excessively high, though this may stem from overly high self-assessment. The tendency to complete tasks thoroughly, keep commitments, and follow rules suggests heightened responsibility and discipline.

Emotionality remains stable except during illness, indicating a stronger logical mindset and strategic thinking in calm states. These align with Clifton Strengths.

### Assessment Results

#### Extraversion

>You tend to have low Extraversion. People with low Extraversion are often seen as reserved, humble, thoughtful, and possessing a unique worldview. Privately, you likely prefer hobbies enjoyed in small groups rather than large gatherings.

Professionally, you excel in roles requiring independent thinking and focused concentration.

Psychological research suggests introverts often possess strong logical reasoning abilities, making them well-suited for roles such as researchers or academics.

#### Emotional Stability

> Emotional stability tends to be high. Individuals with high emotional stability are characterised as being calm, composed, less prone to negativity, and resilient to stress. They can respond calmly even in chaotic situations, meaning they are less likely to make impulsive mistakes.

#### Openness

> Openness tends to be high. Individuals with high openness are characterised by strong curiosity, a preference for new information, an appreciation for the arts, and a spirit of adventure. They tend to be highly motivated to take on challenges and tackle tasks proactively. Their superior imagination and creativity make them well-suited for careers demanding ideas and flexible thinking, such as planning roles, research positions, or fields like design and art.

#### Conscientiousness

> Characterised by a strong sense of responsibility, consistency, keeping promises, and diligently executing plans. Your sincere nature likely earns you the trust of many. At work, you approach tasks earnestly and steadily, demonstrating tenacity to see through what you undertake. Research by Judge et al. at the University of Iowa indicates that individuals high in conscientiousness tend to have higher ‘job satisfaction’ and ‘occupational status’. Many also report greater job satisfaction.

#### Agreeableness

> You tend to score low on agreeableness. Those with low agreeableness are characterised by not reading the room, being competitive and challenging, not being swayed by others, and keeping to their own pace. As they are less concerned with others' reactions or social expectations, they can make strong, forthright assertions. At times, these assertions can even save the group from a crisis.

## 16personalities

It might be best to view 16personalities not as an official MBTI diagnostic tool, but rather as a playful personality assessment.

This is because even if such traits exist, whether one remains consistently in the same state can vary depending on the timing of the assessment.

In that sense, the Big Five model tends to be more reliable.

Regarding 16personalities analysis, in a healthy state, the result tends towards an A rating, whereas when affected by mental health issues, it leans closer to a T rating.

Being an Introvert (I) aligns with the Big Five.

Being a Natural Intuitionist (N) corresponds to high Creativity in the Big Five.

The Perceiving (P) trait aligns with the “Logical” dimension in the Big Five.

The Judging (J) trait corresponds to high “Conscientiousness” in the Big Five.

The Assertive (A) trait matches low “Agreeableness” in the Big Five.

|Domain|Strength|Background|Aspects That Were Difficult to Develop|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cognitive|Analysis, Strategy, Conceptualisation, Creativity|Excessive thinking stemming from ‘cannot afford failure’ and ‘must not make mistakes’|Ability to leap into action, integration with emotions|
|Introspection|Prudence, Thoughtfulness, Ethics|Developed in environments where judgment errors or emotional outbursts were hazardous|Impulsive play, self-disclosure, intimacy|
|Motivation|Desire to learn, curiosity, academic drive|Anxiety without knowing the correct answer; knowledge-seeking as safety assurance|Permission to indulge in personal “wastefulness”, allowing experiential learning|

|Emotions|Intellectual flexibility, fairness|Avoiding emotional entanglement to prevent loss/reversal of experiences of rejection|Tolerance for emotional fluctuations, ability to express and share feelings|

## Examining why these outcomes emerged

### Heightened by the anxiety of ‘not being able to fail’

Not being able to fail is akin to perfectionism. Past influences significantly shape this tendency.
Developed logical thinking to avoid emotional reactions.

### Intense loneliness from lacking dependable people fosters strong learning ability

A tendency to fill the void of loneliness through self-reliance, seeking solutions via information gathering and learning.

A heightened sense of responsibility stemming from a lack of trust in others.

### Creativity developed as an escape from the harshness of reality

Ideas evolved to devise possibilities for confronting real-world problems.

Self-expression, driven by fear-avoidance defence mechanisms, became linked to creativity.

### Summary

These issues can be seen as transforming from my childhood abuse and bullying into current strengths.

While they may appear as a negative legacy, there is actually hope that wounds can be transformed into strength.

However, this should not be interpreted as justifying the abuse or bullying.
