On this page, we discuss expressions we avoid when writing articles on this site.

## Conclusion: We judge that expressions or depictions harmful to children should be avoided

I believe that ‘**providing information in an environment accessible to anyone should fundamentally be based on the premise that it is safe for children to view**’. This is because writing crafted from a child's perspective remains accessible to all readers. This site aims to provide a safe space where anyone can access necessary information, starting from individual ideas rather than necessarily being part of an organisation.

Specifically, we strive to create a child-safe site with the following objectives:

- **Avoid harmful or violent expressions**
- **Maintain information freshness by noting article creation and update dates**
- **Clearly cite sources when using references**
- **Establishing accessible channels such as enquiries and GitHub reviews (via each article's GitHub link), enabling anyone to report inaccuracies in article information**

We will adhere to these rules, periodically review our operational policies, and strive to maintain article quality to provide high-standard information for our readers.

## Internet Issues for Children: Rights Must Be Codified to Protect Them

While modern times have made social interaction easily accessible through SNS, it is equally true that safe internet browsing for children has become more challenging.

On SNS, anyone can post casually. However, on some platforms, this casual posting allows discussions exceeding age restrictions. Even if children are not present during login, they can still access such information without age verification.

Even if films have age restrictions for children, the moment a child is given a smartphone and allowed free access, they are placed in an environment where they can access dangerous information at any time.

<p class="red">Furthermore, issues arise with advertisements on internet blogs, such as complaints being raised when advertising companies display ads containing sexual depictions or violent scenes.</p>

Frequent exposure to such behaviour lacking in common sense can desensitise people to everyday depictions of violence, causing the brain to mistakenly perceive it as normal (commonly known as the “illusion of truth effect”). At worst, individuals may perpetrate harm without even realising it.

So, why must age restrictions be imposed for children?

### Failing to restrict dangerous information and impose age limits poses a significant risk of damaging the developing child's brain.

Research indicates that many symptoms observed in minors exposed to sexual content online bear similarities to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent studies on minors who are victims of technology-facilitated sexual abuse also point to adverse effects strikingly similar to those experienced by minors who have suffered sexual abuse.

<p><b class="green2">According to the DSM-5R, sexual trauma includes witnessing sexual violence. For children, witnessing sexually violent events constitutes an experience inappropriate for their developmental stage, even when no physical violence or injury is involved. </b></p>

From this perspective, it is noted that viewing sexually violent depictions in early childhood can constitute an experience inappropriate for their developmental stage and potentially traumatic. Young children lack critical thinking skills and the ability to distinguish right from wrong, and the developmental risks associated with sexual violence are a significant concern.

Furthermore, one study suggests that increased consumption of sexual media is associated with higher rates of perpetration and victimisation of sexual coercion among sexually active adolescents. More specifically, it has been found that the more frequently adolescents view online pornography or sexually oriented reality programmes, the greater the likelihood they exhibit sexual coercive behaviour.

Next, we will discuss what specific content can be harmful.

## Specific Examples of Content to Avoid

The following are examples particularly likely to have a detrimental effect on children and those who are mentally vulnerable.

● **Depictions of extreme violence, bloodshed, or self-harm**

War footage, torture scenes, realistic violence → Can cause severe physical and mental stress, potentially triggering flashbacks or fear responses.

● **Content inducing suicidal ideation**

Footage containing actual suicide scenes or posts repeatedly stating ‘I want to die’ → Emotions can become entangled through empathy, leading to serious psychological impact.

● **Glorification, trivialisation, or mockery of mental illness**

Examples: ‘Schizophrenia = people who receive radio waves lol’, ‘Depression is just being weak’, ‘Borderline personality disorder is attention-seeking’ → Risks fostering misunderstanding and prejudice, deepening self-denial among those affected.

● **Posts involving sexual exploitation or fetishism**

Lolicon/JK-themed fake videos, revenge porn, AI-generated pornography, etc. → May encourage imitation or justification of sexual abuse and distort minors' sexual self-perception.

● **False information or profit-driven posts concerning medical or mental health issues**

Exaggerated claims like ‘This supplement cures depression!’ or ‘Become a counsellor without qualifications’ → May lead to exploitation through unsubstantiated treatments or paid articles.

● **Posts using aggressive language, discrimination, or inciting controversy**

Examples: Comments like ‘○○ has no right to live’ or ‘You idiot, die’ → Justifies harm and exacerbates victims' isolation and powerlessness.

● **Fake news, perpetrator justification, or impersonation of victims**

Posts silencing victims' voices regarding sexual harm, such as ‘It's worse to stay silent’ → Undermines information credibility and risks becoming a breeding ground for secondary victimisation.

## Harmful content can cause real damage even to adults

**I experienced a chilling fear and sudden physical heat, along with a sense of autonomic nervous system disruption, after encountering such harmful content. The intense stress caused psychological damage severe enough to make me feel at risk of relapse.**

While such posts should ideally be addressed promptly by platforms, in reality, responses can be delayed, leaving recipients to defend themselves.

Particularly when encountered accidentally whilst in a vulnerable mental state, they can rapidly heighten suicidal ideation, posing significant danger.

## Possible Countermeasures

To minimise harm, mindful engagement with social media is essential.

<ul class="menu-list list">
<li>Does the platform offer pre-emptive blocking of sensitive content?</li>
<li>Is it a safe environment for children to use?</li>
</ul>

Keeping these points in mind, one approach is to choose SNS platforms that place minimal burden on mental and physical wellbeing, or to refrain from using them altogether.

Next, we considered practical internet safety rules for use within the home when children are present.

## 7 Key Points for Creating “Internet Safety Rules” Together with Your Child

Discussing these rules together with your child is highly effective.

### Set “Viewing Times” and “Viewing Locations”.

Establishing designated usage times is crucial to prevent information dependency.

- Example: One hour per day, with bedtime after 21:00
- If any problems arise, consult with parents
- Avoid bringing smartphones into bedrooms.

Considering the effects of smartphone blue light, it is vital to minimise disruption to sleep.

### Always consult parents regarding interactions with ‘unknown individuals’

When using platforms, if contacted by someone unknown, consult with parents.

-   Make it a rule to consult your parents when approached via DMs or comments
-   Agree on safety rules: never send contact details, addresses, or photos
-   Ensure you can talk to your parents immediately if you feel troubled or scared
-   Develop the habit of telling your parents straight away about any frightening images or abusive language you see
-   Check with your parents before encountering sensitive information

### Rule: Consider ‘Who might see this?’ before posting

- Do not post your real name, face, school name, etc.
- Develop the habit of checking before posting whether you might be hurting someone

### Never decide on services involving money alone

- Always consult your parents about payments, registrations, paid courses, etc.
- Review examples together of ‘I thought it was free, but then I was billed’

It's also a good idea to regularly review these rules together as a family.

The internet is convenient, but it's also a place where all sorts of information can be confusing. This means it becomes necessary to discern what information is actually needed and whether that information is truly accurate. I believe it's important to establish the habit of regularly consulting with parents about things that children alone cannot fully judge.
