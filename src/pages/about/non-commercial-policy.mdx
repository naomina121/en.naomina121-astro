This page explains why our site does not carry advertisements and is not operated for profit.

## Conclusion: We believe that the more critical the information is to health and daily life, the more it should be accessible to everyone, regardless of wealth.

This site is operated **without seeking profitability and for non-profit purposes**.

Advertisements distract the reader's attention, and considering the impact on readers, I believe it is more considerate not to include them.

This is because as more sites emerge where revenue is closely intertwined with critical information directly affecting health and daily life, readers themselves become less resistant to the idea of securing profitability by selling such content.

While this may not be an immediate issue for different genres, charging for life-critical information and the rise of ad-supported sites prioritise revenue over quality. This leads to a focus on pleasing the majority and maximising readership, removing any guarantee of maintaining article quality.

<p class="red">Particularly concerning is the practice of monetising critical information, such as health advice, through paid articles. This risks creating a black box effect, potentially spreading misinformation. </p>

Next, we examine a case where a curation site abused SEO techniques (search engine optimisation strategies aimed at achieving top search rankings).

## A Case Study of a Curation Site That Backfired in Pursuit of Profitability

In 2016, a certain curation site saw multiple writers continuously updating large volumes of articles exceeding ten thousand characters daily. Searching often resulted in this curation site appearing prominently in the top results.

This curation site became embroiled in a major scandal when it was revealed to be persistently disseminating medical misinformation that consistently ranked highly in search results.

Specifically:

<ul class="list-menu list">
<li>Frequent instances of unreliable, inaccurate information written by amateur writers, not medical professionals (particularly egregious medical misinformation)</li>
<li>Problematic copying and pasting of text from other sites, leading to accusations of copyright infringement</li>
<li>Mass production of low-quality information that appeared in top search results</li>
</ul>

This incident prompted a major update to Google's algorithm, leading to stricter scrutiny of **information directly impacting daily life (YMYL: Your Money or Your Life), such as medical and health information**. This heightened the importance of **E-E-A-T (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)**.
Google's E-E-A-T

<ul class="list-menu list">
<li><strong>Experience</strong>: Whether the content creator has first-hand experience, such as having used the product or visited the location.</li>
<li><strong>Expertise</strong>: Whether sufficient knowledge or skills exist in a specific field.</li>
<li><strong>Authoritativeness</strong>: Whether they are widely recognised as an expert or source of information in that field.</li>
<li><strong>Trustworthiness</strong>: Whether the information is accurate, the site is secure, and it is a reliable source.</li>
</ul>

Applied to the aforementioned curation site,
<ul class="list-menu list">
<li><strong>Trustworthiness</strong>: The articles on the curation site in question lacked clear sources and insufficient medical supervision, meaning the most crucial element, “trustworthiness”, was absent.</li>
<li><strong>Expertise</strong>: Content was written by authors without specialist knowledge, meaning the expertise of the content was not assured.</li>
<li><strong>Authoritativeness:</strong> Insufficient disclosure of the operator or author information, lacking authority.</li>
<li><strong>Experience (new E-E-A-T element):</strong> Lack of direct experience regarding the article's subject matter.</li>
</ul>

This is the case.

However, recent E-E-A-T standards face significant challenges in reliably verifying information. This includes the influence of authority (domain trust based on age), expertise (difficulty distinguishing fake doctors online), and experience (fabricated patient accounts by imposters).

AI summarisation, which synthesises content from the top ten search results, risks failing to provide accurate information if the search results themselves are fundamentally compromised.

AI and crawlers excel at faithfully executing programmes and performing computational tasks. However, they are ill-suited to verifying the credibility of information. This is because the final judgement must be made by humans.

SEO is, at its core, merely an algorithm for evaluating search results at a given point in time. Evaluations change with major updates, making it problematic to treat this as an outcome.

However, it remains a fact that there are providers who, both then and now, market SEO and claim results.

It is not about deceiving or not deceiving; the fundamental purpose of SEO is not to create pages solely for ensuring profitability.

Before profitability, the aim is to share information that contributes to people by updating high-quality articles.

Therefore, SEO solely for securing revenue cannot be considered true SEO.

## This site operates on a strictly non-profit basis, with maintaining information quality as its guiding principle

The internet of the 1990s, unburdened by modern SEO concerns, saw individuals gathering to provide quality information – even covering server and domain costs themselves – simply because they wished to share knowledge.

That era also represented a time when people valued each other, free from profit motives.

**This site was launched by a former professional web designer who believes in the lost information values of that era. We are conscious of maintaining the quality of information on the internet by providing high-quality content.**
