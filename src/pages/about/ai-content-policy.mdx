This page explains our site's ‘Quality Standards Regarding AI Usage’.

## Our Site's Quality Standards Regarding AI Use

Our site's quality standards for AI use are primarily designed to achieve the following objectives:

- **No use of AI image generation**: Free materials are utilised strictly in accordance with their terms of use. Alternatively, images are created manually; no AI-generated images are used whatsoever.
- **Disclose AI-generated content**: Articles supervised by AI or created using AI-provided information must state this clearly at the outset to prevent reader misunderstanding.
- **Do not rely solely on AI for writing**: While AI-generated text may be used as a reference example (including AI literacy) to maintain article quality, the fundamental approach is to prioritise the creation of original content.
- **Verifying AI-generated sources**: For information provided by AI (especially critical health or lifestyle information), always verify whether it is based on primary sources and provide references. If information cannot be found, indicate the possibility of inaccuracy.
- **Use of AI translation**: For English websites, AI translation is used for the purpose of translation.

## No Use of AI Image Generation

To maintain consistency, as creators, we do not use AI-generated images for this site; all images are created by hand.

Each material utilises free resources (such as PhotoAC), adhering to the site's terms of use and employing image creation tools.

Furthermore, due to concerns that AI images may closely resemble existing works – as training data often contains numerous copyrighted materials – we have a strict policy of not using them whatsoever.

## Disclosure of AI-Generated Content

Where AI-generated text is used or articles are created based on information provided, disclosure of AI-generated content will be stated at the beginning of the article. This serves as a criterion for determining whether text was created by AI or by a human.

While the final judgement is made by a human, if AI-generated material was utilised in the process, this will always be stated at the beginning of the article.

## Not Relying Solely on AI for Text Creation

This site fundamentally creates original text. However, to enhance AI literacy as part of information literacy, some articles may be created under AI supervision. This serves as a reference example for AI-assisted writing.

## Verifying Sources for AI-Generated Content

When using AI-generated content, we verify primary sources and write articles with correct references. Should we present a hypothesis deemed plausible without supporting literature, this will be explicitly stated.

As with original content, outdated information is regularly verified against primary sources and updated accordingly. For any article deficiencies, requests for corrections can be submitted via enquiries or GitHub reviews.

## Use of AI Translation

For English sites and certain translations, AI translation is employed.

Translations undergo initial verification; however, please note that the resulting text may not always convey the intended nuance with absolute accuracy.
