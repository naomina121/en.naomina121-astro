On this page, we explain why this site adopted a design centred on luxurious gold and black.

## Conclusion: The design prioritises visibility, stemming from the important theme of health.

Specifically, to convey the importance of information through human visual perception, we employ the prestigious colour scheme of black and gold. Considering readability, the main article text uses an easy-to-read dark grey.

Additionally, the logo is positioned for visibility from the sidebar. The site name, ‘ **naomina121** ’, is my handle, designed to provide reassurance about the author's identity.

The primary use of dark grey to black tones emphasises the weight of important information while maintaining comfortable readability.

Yellow to gold is employed as an accent colour to draw attention.

The red in the logo signifies passion.

## Why the Obsession with Design?

**Having worked as a commercial designer, my livelihood was built upon conveying messages.

As I studied colour psychology and advertising to become a designer, I came to realise that designs that resonate with many people, across any era, are driven by a skilfully calculated technique that moves the heart.**

After becoming a professional, I noticed something I hadn't realised as a novice designer:

That

<div class="box2">

Emotion alone does not move people.

Coolness alone does not communicate.

White space creates the value of a person's writing.

There is a reason why compelling writing attracts people.

There is a reason why compelling design attracts people.

However, the most crucial thing not to forget is ‘**what you want to
communicate for what purpose**’.

</div>

This site had a strong purpose.

That purpose was ‘**to help people avoid being swayed by medical misinformation, enhance their information literacy, and lead healthier lives**’.

In May 2025, my mental illness worsened due to malicious medical misinformation, leading to involuntary admission to a psychiatric hospital.

Before admission, I found myself in a cycle: constantly viewing the perpetrator's articles, which worsened my condition, yet I couldn't stop searching.

After discharge, I continually pondered why people fall for medical misinformation, and why harmful content emerges.

Through this, I arrived at a path.

Recognising the importance of communication, I resolved to leave that significance within this site.

Finally, I wish to demonstrate how much a single word can alter perception.

How you feel about it is entirely up to you.

This should convey how much the impression conveyed by a text can vary between individuals.

<div class="box2">

## The reason your posts aren't read lies in the ‘first five lines’

Even if it's not every day,

Even if you see no reactions,

Even if you have no followers,

If you are, right now, able to keep sharing information itself,

Then you...

### After all, the characteristic of those who thrive is...

If you write that, people struggling with or interested in information sharing...

Will be drawn in and read the text thoroughly.

This is a form of sales letter.

Writing meant to reach someone begins with ‘you’.

It's a one-to-one exchange.

The impression shifts dramatically with just one word: ‘you’ instead of
“listeners”.

In other words, that book's title – ‘The Way You Communicate is 90% of the

Battle’ – isn't entirely wrong.

### People want to get closer to you because they empathise

To sell yourself,
you must naturally possess some charm, right?

That's partly true, partly false.

Certainly, if you have some appeal, people will be drawn to it.
However,

that charm isn't necessarily the strength you perceive yourself to have.

Sometimes, what people truly wish to conceal can become their strength.

Is never showing vulnerability a strength?

No. It's precisely the occasional admission of weakness that can strike a chord.

The world created by this gap fosters human empathy.

People aren't driven by logic; they're driven by emotion.

### It's precisely because people compare...

Strong people are impressive.

That's undeniable.

Yet, simultaneously, some feel empathy for those who can admit vulnerability.

If strength alone were the only charm,
one would become utterly helpless when defeated.

Excessive perfectionism destroys the self.

Some might say ideals are what make people strong.

It's true some make a business out of this.

But those who can voice their vulnerabilities are few, exceedingly few!

That's precisely why

those who speak for them are so reassuring.

### The psychology of finding comfort in others' misfortune over their happiness

The sweetness of misfortune is actually proven in psychology.

You may well be familiar with it:

Schadenfreude – the feeling of delight in others' misfortune or failure.

That said, one cannot rejoice in misfortune that is too utterly wretched.

Schadenfreude is a phenomenon more likely to occur when one lacks self-confidence.

If one's reality were truly fulfilling, such things wouldn't even register.

It is precisely because we feel pain that we compare ourselves to others.

It is said that one in thirty Japanese suffers from mental illness, indicating
how many are swallowed by this stressful society.

In such a harsh environment, it's hardly surprising that most people feel this way.

That's why hearing someone else's vulnerability brings such relief.

### Naturally, success stories can only be told by those who have succeeded.

Stories of finding happiness, of success, can only be told because they were lived.

Boasting drives people away, yet those who can share their failures often leave a better impression.

A measured admission of vulnerability can earn empathy, while never revealing one's true feelings risks trapping oneself.

The existence of those who succeed implies the existence of those who do not.

If effort always paid off, everyone could be a hero.

### That is precisely why those who persevere are geniuses.

If you can persist with something,
even when it brings no reward,
even when there's no guarantee,
then that, in itself, is remarkable.
Now, did you realise?

That by reading the opening lines, you've already read this far.

Which means, that's how crucial the beginning is, whether in writing or speech.

You don't truly believe it, do you?

The necessity of persisting with unrewarded effort.
