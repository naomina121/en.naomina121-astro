<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This site primarily disseminates information on <a href="/mental-health/" class="link">mental health</a> and <a href="/info-literacy/" class="link">information literacy</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This page shares the operational policy and the concept of this site.<br>

<h2>Operational Policy</h2>
<p class="note">
  <small>※ The operational policy is of high importance and requires clear responsibility, so AI-generated text is not used for this page or article pages. While difficult-to-read parts will be corrected as needed, some parts remain uncorrected to guarantee that the text is human-written.</small>
</p>
<p>Here, we have compiled articles on the operational policy.<br>We try to keep it concise and highlight the key points on this page. Please note that the content may be reviewed and changed as necessary. <u class="gold">Clicking on the article titles will allow you to read detailed information on each article.</u></p>

      Why Mental Health × Information Literacy?

    </h3>
    <div class="policy-desc">
    <p>
        I experienced extreme stress due to medical misinformation, which led to a decline in my health and resulted in my being admitted to a psychiatric hospital for protective care. <u class="policy-mark">The necessity of understanding information literacy and mental health is linked to the importance of protecting against health damage caused by misinformation, making it a crucial theme.</u>

      Expressions to Avoid When Writing Articles
    </a>
    </h3>
     <div class="policy-desc">
        <p><u class="policy-mark">I believe that "an environment accessible to everyone means it must be safe for children to view" as a fundamental premise when providing information.</u> This is because text created from a child's perspective is inherently easy to understand for everyone. This site aims to provide a safe space where everyone can access necessary information, starting from individual beliefs rather than necessarily being part of an organization.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Avoid violent expressions that have harmful effects</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Maintain the freshness of information and include creation and update dates for articles</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Clearly indicate sources when using references</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Provide accessible contact points such as inquiries and GitHub reviews<small> (from GitHub links on each article)</small>, allowing anyone to report errors in article information</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We adhere to the above rules, review the operational policy as needed, and strive to maintain the quality of articles to provide high-quality information to our readers.

      Why I Have a Strong Desire to Analyze
    </a>
    </h3>
     <div class="policy-desc">
    <p>
      <u class="policy-mark">I am a victim of abuse, bullying, power harassment, and sexual harassment. Due to adapting to a harsh environment for survival, it became difficult to stop thinking, which led to the emergence of analysis.</u>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Originally, having a moderate amount of thinking and time to rest from thinking is also important for health.
However, due to the harsh environment I survived, I have over-adapted, and as a result, it is difficult to control the act of cutting down on thinking to solve problems. I am also active in this current situation.
Overthinking exhausts the mind and body, and such experiences are not something that should happen to everyone, nor should everyone become like me.</p>
<p>However, it is also a fact that there are such people. By disseminating information, I strongly appeal to such subjectivity and aim to prevent the justification of violence and strongly protect children's human rights.</p>

      Quality Standards for AI Usage on This Site
    </a>
    </h3>
     <div class="policy-desc">
        <p>The quality standards for AI usage on this site are primarily designed with the following qualities in mind.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Do not use AI image generation</strong>: Use free materials in strict compliance with the terms of use. Alternatively, create images yourself; AI-generated images are not used at all.</li>
        <li><strong>Clearly indicate AI-generated content</strong>: If an article is supervised by AI or created with AI-provided information, it is stated at the beginning to prevent reader misunderstanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not rely solely on AI for writing</strong>: To maintain article quality, AI-generated text is used as a reference example including AI literacy, but the basic approach is to create content using original text.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify sources of AI-generated information</strong>: AI-provided information (especially critical information related to health and lifestyle) is always verified against primary sources, with references provided. If information cannot be found, the possibility of inaccuracy is indicated.</li>
        <li><strong>Use of AI translation</strong>: For the English site, AI translation is used for the purpose of translation.</li>
