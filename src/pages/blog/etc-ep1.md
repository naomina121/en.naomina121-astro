## Who made the business cards? That would be me （heh

This isn't my first time making business cards, but <u class="orange">I just somehow felt like making some</u>.
As you can see.
Incidentally, the back side you're curious about is... aaaaaaaaaaaaah? (Noisy, lol)

Please automatically navigate to my site, no QR code required – thoughtful design!!!!!!
If people don't use their fingers, they'll atrophy.
To prevent that, **<span class="big">I had no choice but to do this!!!</span>**

**It absolutely wasn't because it was a faff to include in the design!!**
The only problem is...
There isn't a single person to hand them out to (blimey, lol)
