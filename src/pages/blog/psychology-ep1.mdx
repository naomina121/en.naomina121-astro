## Unfortunately, there is no such thing as 100% correct facts

When you saw this headline, did you think, "**Indeed, that's true**"? Or did you wonder, "Is that really the case?"

In fact, assertive tones may appear to convey truth, but they do not necessarily guarantee accuracy.

If accuracy is required for a headline, then "<span style="color:#de7802;">**Unfortunately, there is no such thing as 100% correct facts**</span>" would be more appropriate.


There are numerous other examples of the trap of assertive language.

Cold reading, frequently employed by fortune-tellers, is one such example.
Fortune-tellers convey statements applicable to anyone as if they were personalised diagnoses.

---

- ‘**You're usually not the type to dwell on things, but when you fail, you can unexpectedly get quite down about it, can't you?**’
- ‘**You came here because you're feeling anxious right now, didn't you?**’
- ‘**Though others may not understand it, you're actually very observant and mindful of your surroundings.**’
- ‘**It's clear that the drive that brought you here is the same force that makes you take on any challenge in your daily life.**’

At first glance, these statements seem plausible, yet they are actually grounded in evidence.
Firstly, cold reading techniques apply principles of psychology.
For instance, there exists a technique known as <span style="color:#c0504d;">encouraging the subject to say YES</span>.
This is one method for gaining trust.
People tend to be reluctant to question statements they judge to be correct.
Does the number of “yes” responses really have such an impact? In fact, it exerts a significant influence.
This method actually prompts the other person to disclose information about themselves unconsciously.
---
<p><span style="color:#d257e2ff;">People are susceptible to the principle of consistency, which drives them to maintain consistency in their actions. Consequently, having disclosed information about themselves, they come to believe they must trust this fortune-teller. </span></p>

<p><span style="color:#d257e2ff;">Furthermore, the confirmation bias—where one tends to focus only on information that supports one's own views—also comes into play. This bias makes it difficult to question the fortune-telling once one has become convinced. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#d257e2ff;">Therefore, the practice of eliciting yes responses while disclosing personal information is highly susceptible to the influence of ‘cognitive biases,’ trapping individuals in the trap of easily believing the fortune teller. </span></p>

Consequently, this method <strong><span style="color:#de7802;">truly taps into the subconscious mind.</span></strong>



As you might imagine, one might have been sceptical upon arriving for the fortune-telling, but as the session progresses and self-disclosure unfolds, a psychological resistance to doubt emerges – an aversion to acknowledging that one is sharing information with someone they don't trust.



Looking back over what has been said so far, you will notice that everything has been stated in an assertive tone.



**Indeed, an assertive tone has the characteristic of making people more likely to believe information, even if it is incorrect.**





If it seems reasonably logical, it can sound as though it is simply the obvious truth.


When considering what constitutes correct information, it is better to ask yourself whether you are being swayed by this information.


Rather than swallowing information whole, it's vital to cultivate the habit of pausing to ask: Is this truly the case?


That said, I don't wish to instil the notion that assertive language is <span style="color:#d97070;">designed to make people believe mistakes</span>.
It's not assertiveness itself that's problematic, but rather accepting things uncritically.
