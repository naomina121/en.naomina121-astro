## Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a 100% correct fact
When you saw this headline, did you think, ‘**Indeed, that's true**’? Or did you wonder, ‘Is that really the case?’
In truth, assertive statements can appear correct at first glance, yet they may not necessarily be accurate.
If accuracy is required for a headline, then ‘<font color="#de7802">**Unfortunately, there are no facts that are 100% correct**</font>’ would be correct.

There are many other examples of the trap of assertive language.

Cold reading, often used by fortune-tellers, is another example.
Fortune-tellers convey content that could apply to anyone as if it were a personal diagnosis.

- ‘**You're usually not the type to dwell on things, but when you fail, you can unexpectedly get quite down about it, can't you?**’
- ‘**You came here because you're feeling anxious right now, didn't you?**’
- ‘**People often struggle to understand you, but you're actually very observant and mindful of those around you.**’
- ‘**It's clear that the drive that brought you here is the same force that makes you take on any challenge in your daily life.**’

At first glance, the content seems plausible, yet it is actually grounded in evidence.
Firstly, cold reading techniques apply principles of psychology.
For instance, there exists a technique aimed at eliciting as many <font color="#c0504d">YES responses as possible</font>.
This is one method for gaining trust.
People tend to be reluctant to doubt content they judge to be correct.
Does the number of "yes" responses really have such an impact? In fact, it exerts a significant influence.
This method actually prompts the other person to disclose information about themselves unconsciously.

<p><font color="#d257e2ff">People are susceptible to the principle of consistency, which drives them to maintain consistency in their actions. Consequently, having disclosed information about themselves, they come to believe they must trust this fortune-teller. </font></p>

<p><font color="#d257e2ff">Furthermore, the confirmation bias—where one emphasises only information supporting one's own views—also comes into play. This bias makes it difficult to doubt the fortune-telling once convinced. </font></p>

<p>
<font color="#d257e2ff">Therefore, the practice of eliciting affirmations while disclosing personal information is highly susceptible to the influence of "cognitive biases", trapping individuals in the trap of easily believing the fortune teller. </font></p>

Consequently, this method **<font color=‘#de7802’>truly taps into the subconscious mind. </font>**



As one might expect, while clients may have been sceptical upon arriving for a reading, the process of self-disclosure during the session fosters a psychological resistance to doubt. They become reluctant to believe they are providing information to someone they do not trust.



Looking back over what has been said so far, you will notice it has all been phrased in a definitive tone.
<br>

**Indeed, a definitive tone has the characteristic of making people more likely to believe information, even if it is incorrect.**

<br>


If the reasoning seems reasonably coherent, it can sound as if it were self-evident.
<br>
When considering what constitutes correct information, it is better to ask yourself whether you are being swayed by this information.
<br>
It is vital to cultivate the habit of pausing to question, ‘Is this truly the case?’, rather than swallowing information whole.
<br>
That said, I do not wish to instil the notion that assertive language is ‘designed to make people believe errors’.
The problem lies not in assertiveness itself, but in accepting things uncritically.
