Listening to The Police's "Every Breath You Take (Japanese title: 見つめていたい)" made me think.

Translating the lyrics into Japanese reveals lines like ‘**There's no one else for me but this person**’, ‘**There's no one anywhere

who could replace you**’, and ‘**I don't know what to do without you**’ – lyrics expressing longing for her throughout. But when you're trapped in this psychological state, you become completely unaware of how dangerous your situation is.

The underlying psychology likely stems from the belief that ‘<font color="#ae3b3b">no one else understands me (or accepts me) like this person does</font>’.

Furthermore, if this feeling intensifies, one might find themselves unable to voice displeasure at things done by their lover,
thinking ‘it's my own fault for being treated this way,’ resigning themselves with ‘it can't be helped,’ or rationalising with ‘this
person is the only one for me’ – unable to blame the other and left to bear the pain alone.

Moreover, driven by a constant fear of loss, they begin to monitor the other person.

This is precisely why the lyrics of ‘*<font color=’#ceda29‘>*Every Breath You Take</font>’ (Japanese title: ‘Mitsumete Itai’ - ‘I

Want to Keep Watching You’) endlessly repeat the idea of constant surveillance.

However, this is actually nothing more than delusion.

Firstly, if this person truly were the only one, then life without them should be impossible.

Their death would not mean the end of one's own life.

Yet, when one is in such a state that they lack the perspective to see things objectively, regaining composure at that moment is exceedingly difficult.

### Take preventative measures daily to reduce the risk of developing this condition.

As discussed, falling into a state of believing **there is no one else but this person** is extremely dangerous.

Being in a state where one can no longer see their surroundings is mentally taxing.

It may even heighten the risk of illness.

Therefore, as a preventive measure,
this site strongly recommends habitually and unconditionally convincing yourself: ‘**There are plenty of other good people besides this one**’.

By taking preventative steps from the outset, you can suppress the risk of developing this condition.

Make it your mantra:

‘<font color="#de7802">**There are countless people who would accept me**’
‘<font color="#de7802">**There are countless others who would be delighted to accept me, overflowing with people willing to do so**</font>’

Make this your mantra.

However, if you have a lover or partner, do keep this thought in moderation – enough to avoid cheating and suffering heartbreak.
