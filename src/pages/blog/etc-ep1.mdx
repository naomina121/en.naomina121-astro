## Who made the business card? That would be me （heh

This isn't my first time making business cards, but <u class="orange">I just somehow felt like making one</u>.

As you can see.

Incidentally, the back side you're curious about is... aaaaaaaaaaaa? （Noisy, eh?

Please automatically navigate to my site, no QR code required – a thoughtful design！！！！

If people don't use their fingers, they'll atrophy.

To prevent that, **<span class="big">I had no choice but to do this!!!</span>**

**It absolutely wasn't because it was a faff to include in the design!!**

The only problem is...

There's not a single person to hand them out to （heh）.
