To be perfectly honest, lol

I'm not particularly good at writing!

It's difficult to write well, and I'm grateful that people still read what I write.

Now, to the main point: when I'm scrolling through social media, I occasionally come across posts saying things like ‘I want to disappear’ or ‘I'm sorry I was born’.

Hearing those voices on social media,

Ah... so it wasn't just me, I find myself suddenly feeling relieved.

When using social media, you realise SOS signals are hidden within posts.

For instance, have you ever come across posts like these?

- ‘**I'm sorry for being born**’
- ‘**I want to vanish**’
- ‘**I can't do my job, I'm finished.**’

People tend to overlook these voices precisely when they're living healthily.

Social media especially has a tendency to recommend content

based on what you usually show interest in or like.

So, what about me?

Well, as you know, I do see these kinds of posts.

Therefore, I suppose I might have a very sensitive side.

## The Background of SOS Signals on SNS

On SNS, posts with many sympathetic comments tend to attract more attention.

For instance, when it seems others share the same feelings and sympathetic comments pile up, it can become aggressive.

When you're stretched thin and suffering yourself, you can't possibly wish for others to be happy,

**thinking how immature I am.**

Even though you don't want to hurt them, you just can't hold back the anger.

Unfortunately, I've been there myself.

Perhaps it might happen again in the future...

However, I believe that precisely during such times, becoming aware of your own heart's SOS signals can lead to change.

Don't go spouting off like you're so wise, Nao, right? lol

## Why Do SOS Signals Appear on SNS?

The background to SOS signals appearing on SNS is influenced by the stress and loneliness felt in everyday life.

Normally, I wouldn't get so irritated by such things.

Why is that?

The more stretched we are, the more signs we seek within ourselves for help.

This creates a dynamic where not only the person seeking help, but also those who empathise with them, simultaneously harbour hidden cries for help within their own hearts.

I myself have made empathetic comments without intending to hurt anyone.

I was already in a state where I'd lost my mental space and couldn't see what was around me.

Being able to empathise means you also understand the feelings of someone who is hurting.

When I see such posts whilst feeling overwhelmed, I inevitably become emotional.

**Yes, Nao has had that experience too.**

Normally, I keep my distance from others, but it's precisely at such times that I find similar posts on social media.

## The Hidden Truth Behind ‘I'm Sorry I Was Born’

Deeply hurtful words conceal a reason.

Typically, healthy individuals needn't contemplate matters of life and death.

The very act of pondering such things signals an emergency where survival instincts feel threatened.

‘I'm sorry for being born’ – but perhaps the words they truly longed to hear
were ‘Thank you for being alive,’ spoken in a place where they could receive them?

No one is born to suffer.

The crushing weight of the fact that society is cruel enough to cause you such anguish,
and that you can only seek solace on social media, is itself an aberration.

## How to overcome it? Awareness and practice of “here and now”

- **Solution**: Cultivating the habit of focusing on “here and now” is crucial.
- **Objects**: Things you touch, smells, the feel of wind or air, tastes, sounds you hear, etc.

Those trapped in suffering tend to fixate on the past.

**If you find yourself unable to focus on the present and truly wish to vanish**

**Recalling the sensations of the present moment is an urgent and vital necessity.**

Finding something you can do right now, something that helps you focus here and now,
can provide a hint that might offer some help in times of need.

Forest bathing is often cited as being effective,
and the reason is that while connecting with nature is beneficial, it also provides an environment that makes focusing on the present easier.

It is also known by another name: forest therapy.

Personally, when I can connect with nature or get outdoors, I feel liberated. Why not give it a try, even if you're sceptical?

However, if you're unable to move due to illness like depression, please don't push yourself.

It's vital to do what you can within the limits agreed with your doctor.

When things get really tough, remember this technique of focusing on “the here and now”. It's worth keeping in mind.

## Summary so far:

<div class="box2">
- The healthier we are, the less we hear the voices of those on the brink.
- When we're hurt by our past or feel mentally stretched, we tend to seek out posts on social media that offer empathy.
- Due to the nature of social media, comments seeking empathy can sometimes, through comparison with others, lead to highly aggressive remarks.
- The true sentiment behind saying ‘I'm sorry for being born’ is a desire for a safe environment where one can feel they belong.
- As a solution, focusing on the “here and now” can help reduce fixation on the past.

I was inspired to write this article because I experienced bullying in the past and often felt I wanted to disappear.

Amidst that, I encountered the idea of “focusing on the here and now”.

Even if I couldn't forget completely, noticing the air, light, and smells around me
allowed me to return to the “present” just a little.

I wrote this hoping this method might offer a small support to someone's heart.

Finally, if you have the mental space to consider this SOS, please think about when you can regain yourself.

The hint should be there.

If you need professional help, please don't hesitate to seek it.

## The Continuation of This Article

Or so it seems, but this article has a continuation.

I wrote it in a slightly—no, quite—malicious way.
