## For those wanting evidence (it's explained rather technically, so feel free to skip it lol)

### Evaluation Based on Research Data

**Comparison of Health Effects:** In the expressive writing paradigm (a writing approach emphasising emotions, personal experiences, and subjective perspectives), participants are asked to write about such events for 15–20 minutes on 3–5 occasions. These individuals generally show significantly improved physical and psychological outcomes compared to those writing about neutral topics.

</div>

**Integrative Effects:** If meditation concerns the momentary observation of mental patterns, behaviours, and flows, journaling is a reflective, retrospective practice. It enables one to connect and perceive the same patterns, behaviours, and flows that might have been overlooked in daily life.

### Empirical Effect Data

**Short-term effects:** One study showed that in just four days, positive emotion journaling (where participants wrote for 15-20 minutes daily about difficult experiences) led to reduced stress, improved ability to manage anxiety and depression, and even improved mood.

**Impact on physical health:** In a particularly interesting study conducted by James Pennebaker, participants who engaged in expressive writing about traumatic experiences showed improved immune function. Compared to those who wrote about neutral topics, they had higher antibody levels and fewer visits to the doctor.

## In other words, similar effects can be expected

**Conclusions based on scientific evidence**

1. **Similar neural activity**: Both practices involve activation of the prefrontal cortex and regulation of the amygdala
2. **Emotional regulation effects**: Emotional stabilisation confirmed in both mindfulness meditation and journaling
3. **Stress reduction**: Similar stress-reducing effects demonstrated in multiple studies
4. **Enhanced Cognitive Function**: Improvements in attention, working memory, and self-awareness
5. **Physical Health**: Boosted immune function, improved sleep, and reduced pain
**Potential Complementary Effects:** Combining journaling with meditation may further amplify its benefits. Drawing inspiration from meditation, engaging in short writing sessions of 5–8 minutes can become a magical way for the brain to focus on what truly matters.

Therefore, writing meditation (journaling) can certainly be expected to yield effects comparable to meditation. Indeed, in terms of cognitive processing and problem-solving, journaling may sometimes demonstrate more concrete and lasting effects. Combining the two is highly likely to yield further benefits through synergistic effects.

## I shall also include here an article presenting some examples of my journaling practice as of 2023

※ At the time of my research, there was already some overlapping studies, but well, that's just part of the charm, I suppose.

The meditation practice known as ‘journaling’ is something even Google employees engage in.

Its benefits include enabling a calm analysis of one's current feelings and fostering self-esteem.

It is also known as **expressive writing, and writing down your anxieties and worries on paper (or your smartphone) has been shown to have cognitive benefits (such as improved short-term memory and concentration), as well as increasing feelings of happiness and helping with depression and anxiety disorders**. This has been demonstrated by research from the University of Michigan and numerous studies by James Pennebaker, the originator of expressive writing.

Having multiple stress coping methods, known as stress management techniques, is never a disadvantage, so I recommend trying this journaling method.

First, write down your thoughts continuously for at least 8 to 20 minutes. In my case, when my mind is not working and I can't think of anything, I don't force myself to write, but write when something comes to mind.

Actually, yesterday, I was feeling strange due to a recurrence of my illness. Let's write about that.

---

As of 30/6

1. Stress level: **6**
2. Mood level: **3**
3. Mood: **Depressed, irritable, self-loathing, anxious, restless**
4. Thoughts: My mood swings were intense; I felt like people disliked me. I went from being hyper to depressed, then aggressive, then plagued by intense self-blame, which gave me indigestion. I thought the stress might also be due to tomorrow's hospital appointment, where they'll decide whether I need to be admitted.

Theme: ‘**Facing the Pain**’

**Writing down current feelings:**

I feel strongly depressed towards myself.

I feel self-loathing and my stomach hurts terribly. Hunger. An overwhelming sense that people are laughing at my low mood or taking pleasure in my unhappiness. I swing between hyperactivity and depression and don't know how to cope. I feel irritable, terribly guilty, and miserable.

**Writing thoughts about this as if observing myself from outside**

Feeling low is tough, isn't it? It's painful.

You might think you can't forgive yourself for disliking yourself, but thinking that just makes it worse, doesn't it?

It's alright, nobody is laughing at you. There's no one here to hurt you, it's alright. Your illness got out of control and your brain glitched, didn't it? It can't be helped, these things happen. It's understandable you blame yourself, but you're alright just as you are. You're alright just as you are. You tried your best, didn't you. Your body was screaming in pain, wasn't it. You're trying hard... but you don't have to push yourself. Rest properly today, resting is your job.

---

**Conduct a calm analysis (identify cognitive distortions)**

Do I dislike myself because I'm trying to create an ideal version of myself? It's only natural that when I'm weak or feeling down, I end up venting my frustrations.

However, experiencing such emotions is also part of being human; it's likely because I have strong ambitions and consequently high expectations.

I think the feeling of hunger stems from stress. Whether the sensation of being laughed at comes from negative thinking or the illness itself is hard to tell.

But realistically, even if someone were laughing at me, the harm would be minimal, so it's probably not worth worrying about. Besides, if such people exist, others don't, so fretting over it is pointless. Believing others take pleasure in my misfortune likely stems from thinking they want me gone or dislike me. This too seems like a sign of persecutionary thoughts or worsening condition. The high energy and mood swings feel like a precursor to relapse; the irritability and severe self-blame probably stem from the brain illness.

---

**Improvement measures regarding the analysis**

If this stems from the illness worsening, rest is advisable. The instability likely arises from the recent discussion about hospitalisation. Though there seems to be a sense of urgency, in the current situation, nothing undertaken is likely to yield positive results. Therefore, prioritising physical condition management and reducing social media frequency should be the first step.

---

Incidentally, I forgot to time myself this time; had I measured it, it might have been more effective. However, when approaching an illness, it's often difficult to make calm judgements, so I felt it was unavoidable.

Initially, I was anxious about the hospitalisation, so that likely played a part too. Since things are already moving towards resolution, that anxiety might have been temporary.

After that, I focused solely on sleeping. That said, I kept waking up multiple times during the night, so my condition probably wasn't great.

The next day I was still emotionally unstable, but I didn't have the energy for self-care. I concentrated on sleeping, and by evening my mood started improving.

---

7/1 Evening

1. Stress level: **2**
2. Mood level: **7**
3. **Mood: Reassured, happy, calm, peaceful**
4. Thoughts: Prioritising self-care and sleep helped my condition stabilise. Though I felt emotionally unstable at times, focusing on sleep and eating properly brought stability. This really drove home how crucial health management is. Rather than just sleeping whenever I can, I realised it's also necessary to exercise a bit to make sleeping easier. I want to start doing what I can, like home workouts or walking.

Then, for today's journaling on 7/2, since I'd calmed down, I wrote about the vague anxiety I felt about “the future”.

As of 7/2

Theme: **The Future**

**Writing down my current feelings**

Nothing comes to mind. I question whether I can do anything. Can I actually do anything? I'm scared of myself changing. I'm scared of myself getting ill. But I also feel like I might be able to do it. I feel like there's potential within me. Perhaps it's fine to just gradually become able to do things. Isn't the spirit of trying first, rather than worrying about not being able to do it, important? It's enjoyable, exciting. I can see hope. Hope for when I overcome my current state. Rather than giving up because of illness, I want to take the long view and believe I can become able to do things, even if it takes time. I want to gain qualifications, become a mental health and welfare worker, help people in difficulty, provide peer support for those with disabilities, understand each other's feelings, help those who struggle to develop what they can do, be a strength to those battling illness. I'm anxious about the period until I can work, but I want to work, I want to try hard. Even if I can't work, I want to keep a record of my recovery. I want to be useful to someone. I feel reassured that it's okay to be who I am now. I think, “It would be nice if I could, but if I can't, it can't be helped”. I can see more hope for the future than before. Rather than rushing, I take things slowly, I take my time. What matters isn't the result, but the process; the feeling of wanting to try. Any outcome provides me with an opportunity for growth. It makes me think about how to live with my illness. If it's all or nothing, then the thrill when things go well is wonderful. I think journaling is amazing – that someone as negative as I was could become this positive. My automatic thoughts have shifted from blaming myself to accepting that it's okay as it is, that changing bit by bit is fine. Whether affirming or denying myself, it was all an internal issue. I'm happy now. I'm grateful for many things. My transformation wasn't solely my own effort; I was sustained by my environment and the people around me. It wasn't just my strength, so my sense of gratitude is immense. I'll keep moving forward. I'll expand what I can do. Even if I succumb to illness, I'll recover again. I'll learn to manage it well.

---

**Thoughts written while distancing myself from the situation**

I understand the fear of change; it's only natural to feel apprehensive about anything shifting. You wouldn't want to risk a relapse by taking on a challenge, would you? You'd want to avoid that if possible. Still, if you feel you can manage it, I think it's worth trying. When you realise your own potential, when you think you might be able to do something you want to do, it's exciting, isn't it? Knowing what you can do is far more important than dwelling on what you can't. Taking time is only natural. You're battling an illness, so it's perfectly fine to take things a bit more slowly. Yes, it would be great to get through this current state. You might stumble again in the future, but I believe you have the courage to try getting back up each time. As a mental health and welfare worker, I originally aimed to be a social worker, so achieving that would be wonderful. Since you've also been helped by others when you were struggling, it would be great to use that experience to help people. You're fine just as you are now. It's okay to be your authentic self. You don't need to force yourself to change; just gradually accept the changes. Being honest with your own feelings is the best thing. I'm glad you're happy now. That sense of being sustained by those around you is truly important, isn't it? If you live without realising it, you might think it's all down to your own strength. But when you realise you're living through the help of others in some way, you feel you're not alone. That's precisely why connections with people are so vital. I think you're doing well with your current positive mindset and efforts. Just don't push yourself too hard. Before the illness gets the better of you, make sure you rest properly. It's alright – living with illness will continue from now on, so let's take it at your own pace without overdoing it.

**Conducting a calm analysis (identifying cognitive distortions)**

By starting journaling, I initially had vague thoughts about the future. Gradually, through my own writing, I became aware of my feelings and clarified what I truly wanted to do. It seems my true self is someone who finds meaning in life by working and helping others.

The mindset of “things not going well is just how it is” shows a very positive willingness to challenge myself, and it's clear my mental state is stable.

I also express concern about overworking myself. This reflects a calm assessment of the situation, including a desire to manage my illness effectively and a new ability to take a long-term perspective. My capacity for gratitude, happiness, and positivity is analysed as being influenced by my inherent resilience (self-healing ability). This is likely reinforced by a core belief within me (

**Precisely because I have experienced hurt and suffering, I do not wish others to experience hurt or suffering**
) and that this remains unshaken. A strong recognition that oneself and others are different beings, coupled with accepting oneself as one is, has likely reduced negative feelings towards oneself. Perhaps by accepting whatever state of oneself arises, setting boundaries between oneself and others, and calmly analysing one's thoughts each time, self-esteem can be strengthened. As a result, resilience increases and stress management improves.

**Improvements to the Analysis**

While there was a slight tendency towards negative thinking, I consider this level quite normal and perhaps doesn't require improvement.

A certain degree of negative thinking is necessary for accepting reality. Adopting a mindset that acknowledges things might not go well from the outset, including the possibility of falling ill, can alter the level of stress experienced when problems arise. Therefore, I judge that maintaining this perspective is actually beneficial.

The real caution lies in overdoing things. Analysing what burdens me and then avoiding excessive effort in those areas seems the sensible approach.

So, while I currently feel guilty about being unable to work, I also want to regain that ability. I aim to manage my illness well and pursue qualification studies.

Accepting my feelings contributes to stress management, so I intend to continue practising this.

Incidentally, when I neglected this self-care, my low mood tended to persist quite severely. However, practising self-care seems to help stabilise my feelings more quickly.

## Result: Metacognition (the ability to objectively observe and recognise one's own cognitive processes) is clearly heightened

It's evident that my ability to control my emotions and engage in analysis – essentially, to view things objectively – has improved.

When feeling anxious, it might be worth considering mindfulness, journaling, or grounding techniques (such as focusing on the present moment, taking deep breaths, and paying attention to those sensations).

If meditation feels too much of a bother, start by incorporating “writing meditation”.
