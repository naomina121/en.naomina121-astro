Hello, it's Nao here. Winter has well and truly arrived, and I've got my hibernation preparations all sorted.



<br>


It seems my chances to soak up the sun have dwindled, and it looks like serotonin—that brain chemical said to be our happiness hormone—is keen to take a rest. A proper rest, it seems.

<br>
<br>


Serotonin: ‘<b>Yeah, I want to rest!</b>’ <small>Blimey, this blighter's suddenly started talking!?</small>


<br>


<span>But the problem is, serotonin taking a break is a matter of life and death for our happiness hormones!</span>


<br>


Serotonin: ‘<b>What?! But I want to rest! There doesn't seem to be any sunlight anyway (teehee)</b>’


<br>


<b class="red">Honestly, it's a real bother, isn't it? Oh dear</b>


<br>


Today, for such troublesome times, there's a way to forcefully activate Mr Serotonin.


<br>


Serotonin: ‘<span>What!?</span>’


<br>


## Methods to Forcefully Increase Serotonin Levels

Even if Serotonin wants to rest, there are ways to forcefully increase its levels.
These are the three methods:

---

### Method 1: Force yourself to soak up sunlight relentlessly, even in winter


Sunlight will boost Mr Serotonin, even if you have to force it.


Therefore,


<span class="red">Even with short daylight hours, just seek out the sun's rays!</span>
Serotonin: ‘<b>Ehh, but I hate winter!</b>’

---


### Method 2: Move around constantly to force serotonin secretion


<b>Moving at a steady rhythm also triggers serotonin secretion</b>


Chewing food thoroughly or activities like <b>walking</b> are also effective.


<span class="red">Additionally, there's a breathing technique that boosts serotonin in just 5 minutes.</span>

Serotonin: ‘<b>I hate moving, but I suppose I could manage breathing?</b>’

### Method 3: Consume Meals Containing Tryptophan and Vitamin B6


To boost serotonin intake effectively, combine foods rich in tryptophan and vitamin B6 – which help synthesise serotonin – with carbohydrates like rice or bread to enhance absorption.


<span class="green2">Foods containing tryptophan</span>


- Soy products such as tofu, natto, miso, and soy sauce
- Dairy products such as cheese, milk, and yoghurt
- Rice
- Sesame seeds, peanuts
- Eggs
- Bananas


<span class="green2">Foods containing vitamin B6</span>


- Oily fish (such as tuna)
- Lean meats like fillet or chicken breast (chicken, etc.)
- Bananas
- Sweet potatoes
- Brown rice
Serotonin: ‘<b>Food is most welcome!</b>’

## Summary

So, even if Mr Serotonin wants to hibernate in winter, there are ways to boost his levels, even if it means forcing the issue.
Serotonin: ‘<b>The world is always unreasonable!</b>’
With that in mind, let's maximise our happiness hormones by increasing Mr Serotonin and get through winter.
