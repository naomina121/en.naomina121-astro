Actually, the article I wrote last time, [The Invisible SOS Signals Appearing on SNS](/mental-health/sns-sos/), might seem rather thin on content at first glance, but it's based on solid reasoning.

This time, I'll explain the reasoning behind this theme and why I chose to present it this way.

---

Now then, did you notice this style of writing differs from last time?

How one speaks can drastically alter impressions.

I deliberately adjust my phrasing according to the article's theme, so if you're curious, I'd encourage you to observe why I've chosen this approach this time too.

The importance of thinking is also covered in [When We Stop Thinking, Humankind Has No Future](/info-literacy/thought/).

## Conclusion: People are driven by emotion. That's all.

Concise is good.

All the better.

So, I've summarised it simply.

### We are driven by emotion because it connects directly to our survival instincts

The older parts of the human brain – the amygdala, which processes fear, and the hippocampus, which stores long-term memory – operate on emotion.

As often noted, including in the well-known ‘Smartphone Brain’ by Anders Hansen, the amygdala is part of the ancient brain; it is the amygdala that renders reason ineffective.

In other words, it judges situations in a state of ‘****fight or flight?****’.

When encountering a predator, doing nothing means certain death.

Therefore,

****At this moment, inducing fear enables an instantaneous response to the dangerous situation. ****

In essence, our human ancestors survived by copying others' emotions (mirror neurons actually mimic feelings through imagining and thinking about others).

Thus, it's reasonable to conclude that many people find it easier to accept complex ideas when presented empathetically because emotional judgement holds higher priority in the brain's functioning.

## When emotions spiral beyond control, it signals human peril

As I omitted from the previous article, [The Invisible SOS Signals on SNS](/mental-health/sns-sos/), when stress becomes overwhelming, the amygdala region of the brain can go into overdrive, triggering intense anxiety and fear.

****But in such a state, maintaining a cool, rational judgement is simply impossible!****

Since ancient times, humans have survived stress by choosing between flight or fight.

Therefore, in a situation where even that is impossible, it's utterly beyond us to engage in complex intellectual reasoning.

It can't be helped – we're only human.

So, what then?

## In fact, “being mindful of the present moment” is scientifically sound

Now, the previous article, [The Invisible SOS Signals on Social Media](/mental-health/sns-sos/), is backed by solid scientific evidence. Let me explain some of the supporting data.

> Based on 44 meta-analyses examining the effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) across 336 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 30,483 participants, it became clear that mindfulness-based interventions indeed hold significant therapeutic potential, although the strength of evidence varies considerably depending on the type of PICOS. Therefore, utilising MBI as an intervention is at least partially supported by scientific evidence. While noting the limitations of the existing literature, ongoing and rigorous experimental research is required to evaluate these interventions.

In summary, while effects may vary depending on the study population, the research findings do not indicate a complete lack of efficacy, suggesting that the effects of mindfulness are promising.
Furthermore, online mindfulness interventions are found to yield moderate effects in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress.

Meta-analysis of individual participant data (objective analysis) confirmed that mindfulness-based programmes significantly reduced psychological distress (unpleasant mental and emotional experiences, including anxiety and depression) six months after the intervention.

Research also indicates that loving-kindness meditation fosters empathy and compassion, leading to observable behavioural outcomes.

In urgent situations or when trauma is triggered, techniques like grounding become essential to focus attention on the present moment.

Incidentally, grounding techniques are widely used as crucial skills for clients experiencing trauma, PTSD, and dissociation. They help individuals experiencing overwhelming memories, intense emotions, or dissociative states recognise the “here and now”. A randomised controlled trial involving 291 outpatients with complex trauma and dissociation confirmed that the Finding Solid Ground (FSG) programme led to significant improvements in emotion regulation, PTSD symptoms, self-empathy, and adaptive functioning.

## Why is focusing on the present moment so effective?

It is thought to be linked to the brain's default mode network.

The default mode network is essentially more active when a person is in a “spacing out” state. Why? Because when people have nothing to do, their minds tend to wander to rather dubious thoughts, ha ha.

****It's not all bad, though.****

For instance, the so-called Default Mode Network (DMN) is said to encourage deep thinking and sometimes boost creativity. It engages in introspective judgement processes like recalling past memories or planning for the future, and is involved in elements concerning the “sense of self” – the pursuit of what defines us.

> [②Default Mode Network (DMN) = Source of Creativity](https://designmentor.jp/knowledgenote/design/brain-network/)

### The Default Mode Network (DMN) is closely linked to mental illnesses such as depression

However, when mental illnesses like depression or PTSD are involved, this DMN becomes overly activated.

Essentially, this leads to abnormal neural activity.

Particularly in mental illnesses like depression or PTSD, the activation of the DMN causes painful memories from the past – memories of being hurt or hurtful words – to be reprocessed and internalised.

Consequently, a phenomenon known as ****rumination**** occurs, where painful past experiences and dark thoughts repeatedly intrude.

> [Rumination and Default Mode Network Subsystems Connectivity in First-episode, Drug-Naive Young Patients with Major Depressive Disorder](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43105))

## Why is focusing on “the here and now” so important?

To put it simply, it is because it can ****curb excessive DMN activation and suppress amygdala hyperactivity****.

During meditation or when focusing on the present moment, one concentrates on external circumstances rather than gazing into the internal world. By redirecting attention away from anxiety or painful memories, brain resources are reduced and memory capacity freed up.

In essence, this enhances cognitive function by refining the hippocampus (memory and learning) and reducing the amygdala (emotions and stress responses).

Furthermore, I suspected that long-term meditation is effective because it likely makes the brain's memory circuits less accessible to painful memories.

Turns out, that's exactly right, ha ha.

It's said that when brain resources are freed up, it becomes harder to form negative neural pathways driven by the negativity bias, leading to emotional stabilisation and the ability to view one's current situation from a broader perspective.

## Why didn't previous articles include data?

And now, the main point.

I deliberately didn't include the answer, ha ha.

If you're curious, you could share this article and post your own opinion.

How you use it is up to you.

I suppose I am a bit of a tease, ha ha.
