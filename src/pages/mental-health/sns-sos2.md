Actually, the article I wrote last time,

[The Invisible SOS Signals Appearing on SNS](/mental-health/sns-sos/),

While seemingly lacking substance at first glance, is based on solid evidence.

This time, I'll explain the evidence behind this theme and why I presented it in this manner.

Now then, have you noticed how this style of writing differs from last time?

A person's impression can change dramatically depending on how they speak.

I deliberately adjust my word choice according to the theme of the text, so if you're curious,

I'd encourage you to pay attention to why I'm using this particular style of expression this time too.

I've also discussed the importance of thinking in [I Stopped Thinking, Humans Have No Future](/info-literacy/thought/).

## Conclusion: People are driven by emotion, therefore.

Concise is good.

All the better.

So, I've summarised it simply.

### Because being driven by emotion connects directly to survival instincts

Humans' ancient brain – specifically the amygdala, which senses fear, and the hippocampus, which stores long-term memory – operates on emotion.

As often noted, including in the well-known ‘Smartphone Brain’ by Anders Hansen, the amygdala is part of the ancient brain; it is the amygdala that renders reason ineffective.

In other words, it judges situations in a state of ‘**fight or flight?**’.

When encountering a predator, doing nothing means certain death.

Therefore, **At this moment, inducing fear enables instant action against danger.**

In essence, our human ancestors survived by copying others' emotions (mirror neurons actually mimic feelings through imagining and thinking about others).

Thus, it's reasonable to conclude that many people find it easier to accept complex ideas when presented empathetically because emotional judgement holds higher priority in the brain's functioning.

## When emotions spiral beyond control, it signals human peril

As mentioned in the previous article, [The Invisible SOS Signals on SNS](/mental-health/sns-sos/), when stress becomes overwhelming, the amygdala—a brain region—goes into overdrive, triggering anxiety and terror.

**But in such a state, maintaining a cool head is simply impossible!**

Since ancient times, humans have survived stress by choosing between flight or fight.

Therefore, when even that is impossible, it's utterly unrealistic to expect rational thought about complex matters.

It can't be helped – we're only human.

So, what then?

## In fact, “being mindful of the present moment” is a scientifically sound approach

Now, the previous article, [The Invisible SOS Signals Appearing on SNS](/mental-health/sns-sos/), is backed by solid scientific evidence. Let me explain some of the supporting data.

> Based on 44 meta-analyses examining the effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI) across 336 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 30,483 participants, it became clear that mindfulness-based interventions indeed hold significant therapeutic potential, although the strength of evidence varies considerably depending on the type of PICOS. Therefore, utilising MBI as an intervention is at least partially supported by scientific evidence. While noting the limitations of the existing literature, ongoing and rigorous experimental research is required to evaluate these interventions.

In summary, while effects may vary depending on the study population, the research findings do not indicate a complete lack of efficacy, suggesting that there is potential for mindfulness to be effective.
Furthermore, online mindfulness interventions are found to yield moderate effects in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress.
> [Effectiveness of online mindfulness-based interventions in improving mental health: A review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735815300623)
Meta-analysis of individual participant data (objective analysis) confirmed that mindfulness-based programmes significantly reduced psychological distress (unpleasant mental and emotional experiences, including anxiety and depression) six months after the intervention.
Research also indicates that loving-kindness meditation fosters empathy and compassion, leading to observable behavioural outcomes.

In urgent situations or when trauma is evoked, techniques like grounding become necessary to focus attention on the present moment.
Incidentally, grounding techniques are widely used as a crucial skill for clients experiencing trauma or PTSD, and dissociation. They help individuals experiencing overwhelming memories, intense emotions, or dissociative states recognise the “here and now”. A randomised controlled trial involving 291 outpatients with complex trauma and dissociation confirmed that the Finding Solid Ground (FSG) programme led to significant improvements in emotion regulation, PTSD symptoms, self-empathy, and adaptive functioning.

## Why is focusing on the present moment so effective?

It is thought to be linked to the brain's default mode network.
The default mode network is essentially more active when a person is in a “spaced-out” or “zoned-out” state. Why? Because when people have nothing to occupy their minds, they tend to think about rather useless things, ha ha.

**It's not all bad, though.**

For example, the so-called Default Mode Network (DMN) is said to encourage deep thinking and sometimes boost creativity. It engages in introspective decision-making processes like recalling past memories or planning for the future, and is involved in elements concerning the “sense of self” – the pursuit of what defines us.

> [②Default Mode Network (DMN) = Source of Creativity](https://designmentor.jp/knowledgenote/design/brain-network/)

### The Default Mode Network (DMN) is closely linked to mental illnesses such as depression

However, when mental illnesses like depression or PTSD are involved, this DMN becomes overly activated.

Essentially, this leads to abnormal neural activity.

Particularly in mental illnesses like depression or PTSD, the activation of the DMN causes painful memories from the past – memories of being hurt or hurtful words – to be reprocessed and internalised, causing further harm.

Consequently, a phenomenon known as **rumination** occurs, where painful past experiences and dark thoughts repeatedly intrude.

> [Rumination and Default Mode Network Subsystems Connectivity in First-episode, Drug-Naive Young Patients with Major Depressive Disorder](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43105))
## Why is focusing on “the here and now” so important?

To put it simply, it is because **it can curb excessive DMN activation and suppress amygdala hyperactivity**.

During meditation or when focusing on the present moment, the emphasis is not on examining one's inner world but on concentrating on external circumstances. By redirecting attention away from anxiety or painful memories, brain resources are reduced and memory capacity freed up.

In essence, this enhances cognitive function by refining the hippocampus (memory and learning) and reducing the amygdala (emotions and stress responses).

Furthermore, I suspected that long-term meditation's effectiveness likely stems from making the brain's memory circuits less accessible to painful memories, so I looked into it.

And indeed, that's exactly the case, I must say.

> [New Research Reveals That Meditation Induces Changes in Deep Brain Areas Associated with Memory and Emotional Regulation](https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/new-research-reveals-that-meditation-induces-changes-in-deep-brain-areas-associated-with-memory-and-emotional-regulation)

It's said that when brain resources are freed up, it becomes harder to form negative neural pathways driven by the negativity bias,

leading to emotional stabilisation and the ability to view one's current situation from a broader perspective.

## Why didn't previous articles include data?

And now, the main point.

I deliberately didn't include the answer, ha ha.

If you're curious, you could share this article and post your own opinion.

How you use it is up to you.

I suppose I am rather mischievous, ha ha.
