Hello, it's Nao here. Winter has well and truly arrived, and preparations for hibernation are nearly complete.


<br />


It seems opportunities to bask in sunlight have dwindled, and it looks like our brain's serotonin – that happiness hormone produced internally – is keen to rest. Properly rest, it seems.
<br />
<br />


<p>Serotonin: ‘<b>Yeah, I want to rest!</b>’<small>Blimey, this blighter's suddenly started talking!?</small></p>


<br />


<p>But the problem is, serotonin taking a break is a matter of life and death for our happiness hormone!</p>


<br />


<p>Serotonin: ‘<b>What?! But I want to rest! Doesn't look like there's any sunlight anyway (teehee)</b>’</p>


<br />


<p><b class="red">Honestly, it's a real bother, isn't it? Oh dear</b></p>


<br />


Today, for such troublesome times, there are ways to forcefully activate Mr Serotonin.


<br />


<p>Serotonin: ‘<span>What!?</span>’</p>


<br />


## Methods to Forcefully Increase Serotonin

Even if Serotonin wants to rest, there are ways to forcefully increase it.

Here are the three methods:

---

### Method 1: Force yourself to get sunlight, even in winter, to soak up as much as possible


Sunlight will forcefully increase Serotonin.


Therefore,


<p><span class="red">Even with short daylight hours, simply seek out sunlight!</span></p>
<p>Serotonin: ‘<b>Oh no, but I hate winter!</b>’</p>

### Method 2: Move around constantly to force serotonin secretion


<p><b>Moving at a steady rhythm also triggers serotonin secretion</b></p>


Chewing your food thoroughly or activities like <b>walking</b> are also effective.


<p><span class="red">Additionally, there's a breathing technique that boosts serotonin in just five minutes.</span></p>

<p>Serotonin: ‘<b>I hate moving, but I can manage breathing, can't I?</b>’</p>

### Method 3: Consume meals containing tryptophan and vitamin B6


To boost serotonin intake effectively, combine foods rich in tryptophan and vitamin B6 – which help synthesise serotonin – with carbohydrates like rice or bread to enhance absorption.


<p><span class="green2">Foods containing tryptophan</span></p>


- Soy products such as tofu, natto, miso, and soy sauce
- Dairy products like cheese, milk, and yoghurt
- Rice
- Sesame seeds, peanuts
- Eggs
- Bananas


<span class="green2">Foods containing vitamin B6</span>


- Oily fish (such as tuna)
- Lean meats (such as chicken)
- Bananas
- Sweet potatoes
- Brown rice

Serotonin: ‘<b>Food is most welcome!</b>’

## Summary

So, even if Mr Serotonin wants to take a winter break, there are ways to boost his levels, even if it means forcing the issue.

Serotonin: ‘<b>The world is always unreasonable!</b>’

So, let's boost our serotonin levels to grab as much of that happiness hormone as possible and get through winter.
